            <h1>Some of Ahmed's Favorite <span>Black Supers</span></h1>
            <p>
              Since I was a young boy, I would read to escape reality. I would read anything whether, it was an encyclopedia, mystery book, newspaper, or a baking recipe. Nothing offered more escapism than fantasy novels and comic books. The latter bringing more to life with its colorful characters and artwork. I never looked at Captain America, Batman, Goku, or anyone else as a White hero. Race has never come into play. However, I have realized that representation matters, in that spirit, I present a few of my favorite Black superheroes.
