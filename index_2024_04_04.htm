            <h1>Some of my favorite Black Supers</h1>
            <p>
                Since I was a young boy, I would read to escape reality. I would read anything
				whether, it was an encylopedia, mystery book, newspaper, or a baking recipe. 
				Nothing offered more escapism then fantasy novels and comic books. 
        The latter bringing more to life with its colorful characters and artwork.
        I never looked at Captain America, Batman, Goku, or anyone else a White heroes. 
        Race has never come into play. However, I have realized that representation matters.
        in that spiritt, I present a few of my favorite Black superheroes.
